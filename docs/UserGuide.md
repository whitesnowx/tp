StaffConnect (SC) is a **desktop app for managing Professors' and Tutors' contact information and associated meetings, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SC can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `StaffConnect.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F08-3/tp/).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your StaffConnect application.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar StaffConnect.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>__(The data in preview image below may not match with the sample data provided)__<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all persons.

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/CS2103 f/Computing v/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a person named `John Doe` to the persons list.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd person shown in the current list.

    * `clear` : Deletes all persons.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Navigability

### Overall UI layout
<br>![UI General](images/UiAnnotationsLayout.png)

#### [UI] Persons Info
<br>![UI General](images/UiAnnotationsAttributes.png)
*Note that the availability will not be displayed in sequential order.
* The values of `Module` will be displayed and stored in capital letters.
* The values of [`Faculty`](#valid-faculty-values) will be stored to their full names.
* The values of `day` part of `Availability` will be stored as their full form such as `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`, `FRIDAY`, `SATURDAY`, `SUNDAY`.

#### [UI] Meeting List
<br>![UI General](images/UiAnnotationsMeetingList.png)

#### [UI] Scrollbars and Menu
<br>![UI General](images/UiAnnotationsScrollbarsAndMenu.png)
*Note that Persons List Scrollbar will open appear when the number of Persons in the list exceed the amount to be displayed by the view.
*Note that the `Exit` button is in the dropdown of the `File` button.

### Mouse and Keyboard controls

Before we get started StaffConnect offers a unique suite of UI controls for users to customise their own unique experience!

1. Clicking any items on the left persons list panel will allow you to select the person's attributes and meeting list to display.
<br>Alternatively, clicking anywhere in the persons list panel then using your arrow keys to navigate and hitting enter to select would give the same result.
<br>**Intended Behaviour:** 
<br> Hovering the selection with mouse or arrow keys would not cause the details panel to switch to the selected person. This is to allow users to browse the persons list panel without switching.
<br>![Region to select the person](images/personPanelRegion.png)
   

2. There is a divider that is draggable up and down to hide and show details on the right side and to customise the look of your application.
<br>![Region to select the divider](images/detailsDividerRegion.png)

3. Each of the 2 detail panels on the right are able to pan in all four directions to view the content:
    - For mouse pad users, dragging around with two fingers the around would pan around the pane.
    - For mouse users, __[Mouse Wheel]__ will scroll up and down while __[Shift + Mouse wheel]__ will scroll left and right.
    - __[Left click + Drag Mouse]__ would pan around in the details pane as well.
    - Keyboard arrow keys are able to pan around as well, but the scroll speed may differ on different systems.
    - There are scroll bars at the vertical and horizontal dividers of the window pane, dragging them in the respective direction will pan around as well.
   
4.  The Result display:<br>
    The scroll bars can only be scrolled by two ways:
      1. For mouse pad users, dragging around with two fingers the around would pan around the pane.
      2. For mouse users, __[Mouse Wheel]__ will scroll up and down while __[Shift + Mouse Wheel]__ will scroll left and right.
      3. Simply dragging the scroll bar with a left mouse click. 
      <br>**Scrolling by arrow keys is not fully supported in the result display**

5.  The Command box:<br>
    The input can only be scrolled by __[Holding Left Click + Drag Mouse]__  to the edge in the direction to scroll. This is to allow making adjustments on very long commands.


<Br><Br> 
### Alternative UI arrangements
<br>![first alternative ui](images/firstAlternative.png)
<br>
<br>![second alternative ui](images/secondAlternative.png)

**Intended Limitations**
1. The divider position is not controllable by keyboard input, hence the only way to customise the look is mostly by mouse input.
2. Panel switching by keyboard input, like a terminal is not supported.
3. Font sizes does not automatically resize in this application, scroll bars will appear in smaller window variants of this application to help with the viewing of details.
4. The UI will do a soft reset on its divider position every time the application is relaunched, as this is to allow users who wish to fall back to the default layout settings.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

  e.g. `filter m/CS2030S f/Computing` will return `Charlotte Oliveiro`

Examples:
* `filter m/CS1101S` returns `Alex Yeoh`
  <br>![result of `filter m/CS1101S`](images/AfterFilterCommand1.png)
* `filter f/Computing t/professor` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `Charlotte Oliveiro`, `David Li` and `Roy Balakrishman`

  <br>![results of the above-mentioned edits](images/BeforeFilterCommand1.png)
  <br>You can see that for `Roy Balakrishnan`, while he is available on `Monday 12:00 13:00` and `Thursday 12:00 13:00`, he does not have tags `friend` and `youtuber`.
  <br>![Roy Balakrishnan not having other tags](images/BeforeFilterCommand2.png)
  <br>`filter f/soc t/professor t/friend t/youtuber a/mon 12:00 13:00 a/thurs 12:00 13:00` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `Charlotte Oliveiro` and `Irfan Ibrahim`.

### Sorting persons: `sort`

Sorts the list of persons based on specified attribute.

Format: `sort [n/] [p/] [m/] [f/] [v/] [s/] [meet/]`

* By default, sorting is done in alphanumeric order.
* The order of character priority would be letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), special characters (!@#$%^&*).
* The capitalisation of the letters do not affect their priority such that `Aaron` will have same priority as `aaron`.
* For attribute with exact same values, the tie-breaker is determined by their added order.
* For sorting of multiple attributes, the weightage will be determined by the order in which it was entered. E.g `sort m/ p/ v/` will sort persons by their module, among those with equal modules would then be sorted by their phone number and similarly for venue.
* `s/` sorts the list by person with the earliest meeting
* `meet/` sorts the list by person with the earliest meeting, followed by alphanumeric order of meeting description

Examples:
* `sort m/ p/` returns person by ascending module codes followed by ascending phone numbers `CS2000 80000000`, `CS2000 90000000`, `CS3000 80000000`followed by `CS3000 90000000`
* `sort n/` returns person by ascending names `Alex`, `Bernice` followed by `Charlotte`
* `sort p/` returns person by ascending phone numbers `87438807`, `91031282` followed by `92492021`<br>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the generated data file with the file that contains the data from your current StaffConnect device.<br>
**Q**: Why are concurrent or past meetings allowed? <br>
**A**: This is to allow greater flexibility for users who wish to segregate meetings of different topics happening concurrently or users who wish to store meetings in the past for bookkeeping purposes etc..
**Q**: Why are meeting's description with the same content but different case-sensitivity allowed?
**A**: Sometimes the user would like to have finer control over how they want to differentiate between topics, and a single capital letter could make that difference.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **When adding/editing phone number with a descriptor**, If you try to add a number with a descriptor such as `98731094 (home)`, the application rejects this input and advise the user to only provide phone numbers with numerical values only. The phone number is not intended to store phone number descriptor but users can consider using tags such as t/homePhone as a workaround.
3. **When adding/editing name containing special characters**, If you try to add a name such as `Jason s/o William`, the application rejects this input and advise the user to only provide name with alphanumeric values only. The name is not intended to store special characters but users can consider using `so` or `son of` as a workaround. If a person's name includes special characters (characters not included in modern English) like arabic characters (such as أ, ب, ت, etc.), it should be latinized first.
4. **When adding/editing name that already exists in the staff book**, if you try to do so, an error message will be prompted, as two persons are considered the same person as long as they have the same name. It is inplausible to has two persons with the same name but other different attributes.
5. **When adding/editing venues containing space with an attribute prefix**, If you try to add a venue such as `Room 12 t/r`, the application will add a person with a venue `Room 12` and a tag `r` instead of the intended venue `Room 12 t/r`. The venue is not intended to store venues that contains a space followed by an attribute prefix but users can consider omitting the space or replace with a hyphen such as `Room 12t/r` or `Room 12-t/r` as a workaround.
6. **When generating the default file and exiting via the `Exit` button**, If you try to generate the default JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/staffconnect.json` by running the JAR file, without manipulating any data and exiting via the `Exit` button, the JSON file would not be generated. You may consider using the `exit` command via the command line interface to generate the default JSON file instead.
